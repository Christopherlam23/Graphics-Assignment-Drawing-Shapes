Assignment 1 - Drawing Primitives

You are to implement an interactive application with easy to use GUI which allows you to perform the following tasks:

1. A proper Scalable Coordinate system which can accommodate a drawing of any size.
2. Draw a line using the
   a. DDA line algorithm
   b. Bresenham Line algorithm

- your line attributes should have the following options:
   Solid
   Thickness
   Dotted
   Dashed

3. Draw a polygon (regular and irregular) of any shape using Java Polygons
4. Draw a Circle using the Bresenham Mid-Point Cirlce algorithm
5. Draw an Ellipse using the Bresenham Mid-Point Ellipse algorithm

Note: Use Java Swing Component for the GUI. E.g JFrame,JPanel etc.
